Error-[VCS_COM_UNE] Cannot find VCS compiler
  VCS compiler not found. Environment variable VCS_HOME 
  (/opt/synopsys/vcs-mx/N-2017.12-SP2-2/linux) is selecting a directory in 
  which there isn't a compiler 
  '/opt/synopsys/vcs-mx/N-2017.12-SP2-2/linux/bin/vcs1' for a machine of this 
  type 'linux'.
  Please check whether 'VCS_HOME' is incorrect; if not, see below.

 Perhaps vcs hasn't been installed for machine of type "linux".
 Or the installation has been damaged.
 We determine the machine type from uname; maybe uname is incorrect.
 You can fix installation problems by reinstalling from CDROM 
 or downloading it from the Synopsys ftp server.
