# Purpose:

The purpose behind this repository is to showcase the coding, projects, and reports done for both ECE526 and ECE527 classes. These classes focused on **"Digital Design with Verilog and System"**, as well as **"Application Specific Integrated Circuit Development"**. All the reports, codes, and majority of Verilog files have been personally created in order to successfully implementation specifications of each report's needs. Languages found within these files are **Verilog, System Verilog, Tcl/Scripts, and some Unix/shell commands**. All necessary documentation will be provided for each respective report and the corresponding folder.
