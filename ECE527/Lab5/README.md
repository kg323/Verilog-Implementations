# **10.1**

Write the Verilog code for a module which includes:

A write pointer 0 â€“ 1023

A read pointer 0- 1023

A RAM 1024 X 8

(Use the RAM library module, in guidance)

The circuit will:

Allows sequential writes to the RAM and set a pulsed flag &quot;FULL&quot; when it is full

Allow sequential reads from the RAM and set a pulsed flag &quot;EMPTY&quot; when it is empty

The data written should be a repeated decrementing count 255-0

Inputs are:

8-bit data in

Clock (clk)

Write/Read enable

Reset (rst\_n)

Outputs are:

8-bit data out

Full flag

Empty Flag

I/O cells

Add input and output pad cells, as shown in guidance

Misc

Add a &#39;timescale   1ns / 1ps

# **10.2**

Write a test bench to test this:

Write 1024 words to the RAM

Read 1024 words from the RAM

Display:

Full and Empty flags

Write/read enable

Data in and data out

Timing:

Read and write cycles take just 1 clock

Generate a 10Mhz clock

Add a &#39;timescale 1ns / 1ps

Add directive to include SDF timing

# **Conclusion**

We can see that based on our results from the simulated outputs, and the waveforms, that the codes are indeed working as expected and meet expectations for the lab. The only noticeable issue stems from the flags, in which they stay on after being set upon meeting the conditions. This may be remedied by simply having them reset after meeting the needed conditions. Aside from this, no further issues can be noted, seeing as how the lab was performed in accordance to what was needed
